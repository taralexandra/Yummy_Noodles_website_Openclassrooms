# Yummy_nouilles_code_Openclassrooms 📒 🥘 🍜

This project is actually the result of 2 tutorials i followed with the french website OpenClassrooms, in the first project i had to create the full wireframe and layout design for the website Yummy Nouilles (noodles) and then in the second course we learned to integrate the code in Visual Studio Code to create the final website. 

- This is a "simple" project in HTML and CSS. 

- I had a lot of fun discovering Figma 🎨 a little more that i already did in the past years and this was all about cooking and noodles sooo this is totally my kind of fun project !! 😄

## About this project
If you want to explore the courses i followed, please note everything is in french 🇫🇷 and this was only my second project in HTML & CSS (see my repo named Robbie Lens to see the first one), the lessons are teached in french, so i keep the language for the content. Note that I am pretty more happy with the organization of the file in this project rather than with the first website for the photographer Robbie Lens... 🥳 

The first course (the figma steps) :

The second course (the integration with HTML and CSS) :

Enjoy ! 🙂
